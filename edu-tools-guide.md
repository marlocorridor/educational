3. **Check renewal periods:** Some licenses need annual renewal. Set calendar reminders to reapply before they expire.

4. **Join educator communities:** GitHub Education Community, JetBrains Educator Community, and others provide lesson plans, best practices, and peer support.

5. **Start small:** Don't feel pressured to use everything at once. Start with 2-3 tools that address your immediate needs, then expand gradually.

6. **Institutional licenses first:** Check with your IT department before applying individually - your university may already have enterprise agreements that provide broader access.
